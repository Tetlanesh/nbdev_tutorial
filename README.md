## What is `nbdev` and how to get it working

I’m on Win10 and instead of playing with wirtualbox I went with `WSL`
and `Anaconda` so not all steps may apply to You if You run native Linux
or Mac or Windows.

1.  Install WSL (using windows store)
2.  Install anaconda in WSL terminal - follow steps in [this
    blog](https://emilykauffman.com/blog/install-anaconda-on-wsl)
3.  create new conda env using
    `conda create --name env_name python=3.10`
4.  Activate your new env using `conda activate [env name]`
5.  install nbdev and few other packages
    1.  `conda install -c fastai nbdev`
    2.  `conda install jupyter ipykernel pandas scikit-learn`
6.  register your env with jupyter:
    `python -m ipykernel install --user --name=[your env name]`
7.  install quarto:
    1.  I’ve used `Linux Tarball` as platform on [download
        page](https://quarto.org/docs/download/)
    2.  after selecting your download method you will get list of
        commands to run, in my case it was:
        1.  `wget https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/releases/download/v1.2.258/quarto-1.2.258-linux-amd64.tar.gz` -
            downloads tarball
        2.  `mkdir ~/opt`
        3.  `tar -C ~/opt -xvzf quarto-1.2.258-linux-amd64.tar.gz` -
            extract content of tarball
        4.  `mkdir ~/bin`
        5.  `ln -s ~/opt/quarto-1.2.258/bin/quarto ~/bin/quarto` -
            create a link to quarto directory in your home directory
        6.  `( echo ""; echo 'export PATH=$PATH:~/bin\n' ; echo "" ) >> ~/.bashrc` -
            add the link to your PATH
        7.  `source ~/.bashrc` - rerun the .bashrc
        8.  `quarto check` - you should get all ok (except R) and it
            should report your conda repo version of python
8.  create github repo and clone it to folder where you want to keep
    yddddour project files - `git clone [repo url]`
9.  navigate to your project dir and run `nbdev_new` - this will create
    multiple new files and directories needed for library to nbdev,
    documantation, ci, etc - most importantly creates `nbs` dir where
    the notebooks sits and `[your_project_name]` dir where the actuall
    library code will sit
10. run `nbdev_export` - this will run all export commands from your
    project (we will explain more on that later - if you havent changed
    anything this should create core.py in your project code folder that
    reflect `00_core.ipynb` content).
11. run `pip install -e .` - this will install your package for local
    development allowing you to import stuff
